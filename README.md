# BulkImageResizer

 BulkImageResizer automates image resizing and compression of any number of images in a folder. I developed this script to automatically resize and compress the images for responsive web development.

### Prerequisites

* I have written and tested this script with Python 3. But 
* Please install Pillow library with the following code on your terminal.
